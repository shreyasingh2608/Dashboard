GLOBAL ESG &amp; SUSTAINABILITY MONITORING DASHBOARD
I recently visualized a cross-section of global development data — from CO₂ emissions per capita to life expectancy and electricity access trends across regions — as part of my Data Analysis Internship at Unified Mentor Pvt. Ltd.

📊 Project Highlights-
• Analyzed CO₂ emissions showing how energy consumption and industry impact varies globally
• Explored the relationship between government effectiveness and life expectancy
• Tracked progress in electricity access across regions over the last three decades
• Identified clear regional disparities in health outcomes

📈 Key insights include- 
• Fossil fuel producers and high-income countries dominate per capita CO₂ emissions
• Strong governance aligns with higher life expectancy
• Electricity access has improved worldwide, though inequalities persist
• Regional health disparities remain a challenge

This dashboard reinforces how **policy, infrastructure, and governance** shape global wellbeing — and why data-driven decisions matter now more than ever.

Grateful to be shaping my analytical skills through hands-on work at Unified Mentor Pvt. Ltd. 🚀
